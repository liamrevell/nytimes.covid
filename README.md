# Analysis of U.S. age-adjusted death rate through time

On April 24th, 2021, the NYTimes published an analysis of the 1900-2020 age-adjusted U.S. death rate / 100,000 population. This article can be viewed here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/23/us/covid-19-death-toll.html.

Based on her analysis the author, Denise Lu, concluded that 'The U.S. death rate in 2020 was the highest above normal since the early 1900s â€” even surpassing the calamity of the 1918 flu pandemic.' I identified several logical and analytical flaws led to this conclusion (e.g., https://twitter.com/phytools_liam/status/1385789068844355584, https://twitter.com/phytools_liam/status/1385811374912245760, https://twitter.com/phytools_liam/status/1386053272910409731).  

The code of this repository, first, reiterates Lu's analysis, and, second, shows how different decisions in the analysis can lead to wildly different conclusions.
